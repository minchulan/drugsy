## Good Habits

Welcome to Good Habits, a Rx Drug Finder app. Good Habits is built with ReactJS and leverages dynamic interactivity and asynchronous code via server communication. For my phase 2 project I hoped to build something that pertained to my career as a pharmacist. After several low-fidelity wireframe designs and much consideration, I came to the realization that a 'prescription-drug-finder-app' would be the most attainable for me as a student developer. I hope to build upon this project with additional integrations and functionality that I could use in a pharmacy setting in the future.

## Lessons Learned

In Phase 2, I learned the fundamentals of the ReactJS language, specifically Components and Props, State & Events, Information Flow, React Forms, Component Lifecycle & React Router. I met the learning objectives which were to design a React component hierarchy based on a wireframe, create components that interact with an API, and incorporate client-side routing into a single-page application in React.


## Installation

To install, just fork and clone this repository. Once you cloned it in your terminal, make sure you `cd` into the correct folder.

## Roadmap

- Additional browser support
- Add more integrations


## Core Deliverables

As a user:

1. When the app starts on page load, dynamically render a list of Rx drugs.
2. Add a new drug to the page by submitting the form.
3. Delete a drug by clicking on the delete button, or trashcan icon.
4. Search for drugs by Rx drug name and see a filtered list of drugs on the page.

## Example

The below screenshot demonstrates the working functionality of the app.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
